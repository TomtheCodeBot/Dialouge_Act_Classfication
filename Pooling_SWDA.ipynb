have not had to uh until just recently',\n"," 'i guess we have got a a daughter who is eighteen months and another one on the way',\n"," 'so',\n"," 'uh huh',\n"," 'we needed to start doing more of

can do that',\n"," 'i know',\n"," 'i have a daughter who is ten',\n"," 'and we have not really put much away for her college up to this point',\n"," 'but uh we are to the point now where our financial

then the money that i will be making this summer we will be putting away for the college fund',\n"," 'um sounds good',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'i guess we are we are just at the point uh',\n"," 'my wife

uh',\n"," 'and he just forwarded that on to me',\n"," 'and uh it sounded like it would be an interesting project',\n"," 'uh huh',\n"," 'to participate in',\n"," 'so i',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'it will be interesting to see what',\n"," 'sent back mail',\n"," 'it would be interesting to see how the data base',\n"," 'so well i guess we are talking about the experiment',\n"," 'uh huh',\n"," 'uh probably need to try to get back on the topic',\n"," 'but uh it is hard to talk about finances without without getting to uh dollar figures i guess',\n"," 'uh huh',\n"," 'you know',\n"," 'we could talk about some of the long range goals',\n"," 'and',\n"," 'well what other long range goals do you have besides college',\n"," 'uh well i think either my wife or i would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point',\n"," 'uh huh',\n"," 'uh i guess we will have to factor that in if we are not working for employers that happen to fund that',\n"," 'it seems like every year my employer just gives back you know a little bit your tuition reimbursement',\n"," 'uh huh',\n"," 'i mean they use to reimburse one hundred percent',\n"," 'and now it is uh now it is reimbursement depending on the grade you get in class',\n"," 'and uh it is a real shame from what we had before uh because we are',\n"," 'right',\n"," 'uh actually i lived over in europe for a couple of years',\n"," 'i lived in germany',\n"," 'and in germany they do not have the jury system',\n"," 'what they do is they have uh three judges basically',\n"," 'and you get up there',\n"," 'and the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence',\n"," 'and your defense attorney presents their evidence',\n"," 'and those three guys take the evidence go off figure it out and then come back and say whether you are guilty or not',\n"," 'sneezing ou ou our judicial system is in such total chaos',\n"," 'laughter',\n"," 'i think what they need to do is they need to somehow lipsmack take the money out of it',\n"," 'i mean when you have a man that is signed a a a statement saying he is guilty',\n"," 'we have a a family called all day family',\n"," 'they were all murdered',\n"," 'uh huh',\n"," 'all the people signed confessions',\n"," 'they went to a trial by jury',\n"," 'they been trying these people now for twenty two years ever since i was a child',\n"," 'wow',\n"," 'and what they have done is they have bought mercedes after mercedes after mercedes is what they have done',\n"," 'has nothing to do with justice whatsoever',\n"," 'breathing well you know it is it is one of those things',\n"," 'i mean uh uh i would have to look at it',\n"," 'i if they did it with the uh just the judges the police have to do a lot better job of making sure that their evidence is airtight',\n"," 'because the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day they know all the procedures',\n"," 'they know what is good and what is not',\n"," 'they would be able to say i m sorry',\n"," 'you cannot use this as uh evidence you know because it was either illegally obtained or whatever',\n"," 'and you know you would not have this uh uh theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it to the to the jury',\n"," 'and then the judge says oh no',\n"," 'd disregard that',\n"," 'come on',\n"," 'any jury is not going to disregard the evidence you know laughter',\n"," 'uh that is true',\n"," 'i i i think our judicial system is attorney welfare myself',\n"," 'that may very well be',\n"," 'i i hold it in the utmost contempt',\n"," 'uh',\n"," 'the uh d my favorite is the police department',\n"," 'breathing they are not aimed at the criminal',\n"," 'the judicial system is aimed at the citizens',\n"," 'because you and i we have work schedules',\n"," 'we can be called at work',\n"," 'we have social security numbers',\n"," 'they can trace us down',\n"," 'we have telephones',\n"," 'then we have checkbooks',\n"," 'criminals have none of these things',\n"," 'they are real difficult to catch',\n"," 'and if they do catch them they do not get any monetary gain out of it whereas us we write a check',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'so where do you think they target their efforts',\n"," 'that is true',\n"," 'you d',\n"," 'they target their efforts toward the citizens',\n"," 'well',\n"," 'not the criminals',\n"," 'how would you go about changing it',\n"," 'throat clearing you know that is a',\n"," 'i ve nailed the problem down',\n"," 'but i',\n"," 'laughter',\n"," 'laughter',\n"," 'leave the details up to somebody else huh',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'i m going to have to leave those details like what would you do about',\n"," 'i think to begin with you would h you would have',\n"," 'like here in atlanta area our crime rate is just astronomical',\n"," 'yet you go out on the streets',\n"," 'and they are giving speeding tickets',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'i think somehow you have to separate the revenues from',\n"," 'well you know uh talking about the lawyers you know what might very well do uh cause a uh a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that is to set the fees for cases',\n"," 'it is kind of like do it do it in the similar vein similar like uh v c r or television repair',\n"," 'if you take your t v in a lot of these t v repair places will say well i ll repair your t v for a hundred dollars',\n"," 'and if he gets in there and starts rooting around and finds something in there that is really tremendously wrong with it then he eats it',\n"," 'he he repairs it gives it back to you and takes your hundred dollars',\n"," 'now if he comes in and says you know i ll repair your your v c r or somebody else is v c r for a hundred dollars gets in there',\n"," 'maybe it is a blown fuse',\n"," 'takes him two minutes',\n"," 'he fixes it',\n"," 'he still charges you that hundred dollars',\n"," 'so maybe if we did that with the lawyers so that you know whether it is a murder case or a you know a civil uh somebody suing somebody else you get x dollars for that case',\n"," 'and that is it',\n"," 'now',\n"," 'none of this',\n"," 'i firmly believe in that',\n"," 'because when you get the most heinous of crimes have you ever noticed you always get the most renowned defense attorney',\n"," 'oh yeah',\n"," 'and here is this bum that did not have a job',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'and he is got a attorney that you and i could never afford',\n"," 'that is true',\n"," 'who is',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'paying for that',\n"," 'um y well you you know laughter you are talking to part of them that is paying for that laughter',\n"," 'laughter yeah',\n"," 'and you are talking to the other half that is paying for it',\n"," 'laughter',\n"," 'laughter that is right',\n"," 'you know that is it it is it is amazing',\n"," 'and and when you stop and look at it i mean the judges th they are all former lawyers',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'well that is another problem',\n"," 'i think to really correct the judicial system you have to get the lawyers out of it laughter',\n"," 'laughter',\n"," 'i mean they are they are totally and morally bankrupt without any ethics whatsoever',\n"," 'and with that type person running it i mean you you could expect that you',\n"," 'do you know anyone that uh is is in a nursing home or has ever been in one',\n"," 'no',\n"," 'but i my grandparents were looking into it before',\n"," 'so i know what they have said',\n"," 'uh huh',\n"," 'uh huh',\n"," 'well i m trying to think',\n"," 'my uh uh wife is grandmother had alzheimer is',\n"," 'and they were going to put her into a a nursing home',\n"," 'and uh they when they put her in she had all kinds of trouble',\n"," 'and the nursing home made them come noise and take her back because she laughter was being a a you know a a nuisance or worse than a nuisance',\n"," 'i mean',\n"," 'oh they thought it was too much of a bother',\n"," 'she sort of went you know bananas',\n"," 'and they could not could not deal with her sigh',\n"," 'so i guess you need to uh know whether it is a you know a no deposit no return kind of thing whether laughter',\n"," 'right',\n"," 'if they are equipped too to handle the kind of patients you are going to have',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'you know put in there too',\n"," 'because i know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still',\n"," 'right',\n"," 'they wanted some place they can go and have their meals and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her',\n"," 'but they wanted to be independent as well',\n"," 'right',\n"," 'have their own room',\n"," 'my grandmother actually was in a a nursing home that uh',\n"," 'there was a retirement hotel and then a uh',\n"," 'there was some sort of full time care place that was also associated with it',\n"," 'so for uh the first few years she had her own apartment and you know made her own meals sometimes but could could also go and eat someplace else',\n"," 'uh huh',\n"," 'and then uh as she became less able to take care of herself then she moved into this other part that was able to uh provide full time care',\n"," 'and uh she did not have to do anything anymore',\n"," 'but my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly',\n"," 'and that is som',\n"," 'i do not know whether that is because they you know sort of give up hope once they get in there or what the the reason is',\n"," 'but i think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only like six months or something',\n"," 'well a lot of it is probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'they need health care',\n"," 'so they are already ill before they go',\n"," 'right',\n"," 'that is probably a large factor',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'if if you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you then you stay where you are',\n"," 'then you only go there as a last resort',\n"," 'uh huh',\n"," 'or people send you there as a last resort',\n"," 'right',\n"," 'right',\n"," 'that is what my grandparents',\n"," 'it was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened there was somebody there for them',\n"," 'uh huh',\n"," 'so that was their thinking',\n"," 'somebody who would know what to do in the event of an emergency',\n"," 'right',\n"," 'and also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed while they still had choices to make',\n"," 'right',\n"," 'so they would not be stuck going into just whatever nursing home was available at the time',\n"," 'i guess that is a problem too for people wait lists and all',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'i guess',\n"," 'that uh',\n"," 'you cannot always get in when you want too',\n"," 'and of course you cannot just sit around and wait',\n"," 'right',\n"," 'when you need it you need it',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'i guess',\n"," 'and the money is also another issue how you are going to pay for it',\n"," 'right',\n"," 'at that stage of life you only have so much money left',\n"," 'and i guess it is not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put it in their savings',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'i mean it is kind of fair',\n"," 'but it is also not fair because they have their own children to raise',\n"," 'sure',\n"," 'so it is another problem',\n"," 'and you probably if it were you you probably would not want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price',\n"," 'right',\n"," 'right',\n"," 'so it it is just so complicated anymore i think noise',\n"," 'people outlive their savings',\n"," 'and with medicine being the way it is you are extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down',\n"," 'and they are not necessarily enjoying life anymore',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'well maybe that is the purpose of the nursing home is to have them go someplace where they can see that it is not worth continuing',\n"," 'it is just a shame that is the way it has to be',\n"," 'i think',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'the retirement home idea is a nice idea to go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace to stay',\n"," 'and cause like if your spouse died all alone it would be nice to go someplace with people similar to you',\n"," 'right',\n"," 'to have friends',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'i ve known quite a few people that have uh gone to retirement communities',\n"," 'i do not know if they have them back there',\n"," 'but here in california and in ari',\n"," 'noise okay',\n"," 'uh so what do you think uh about putting the elderly in a nursing home',\n"," 'well i think that it it varies on on the individual basis',\n"," 'huh',\n"," 'uh sometimes it is there is no alternative',\n"," 'uh huh very faint',\n"," 'uh you do not have uh uh family available or family that is uh',\n"," 'you may not even have family that is uh uh in you know who are around',\n"," 'that is true',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'so sometimes it is not an alternative',\n"," 'huh very faint',\n"," 'and i think uh but i think also sometimes it can be uh a benefit if it is for a short time',\n"," 'sometimes in a nursing home',\n"," 'uh huh',\n"," 'uh especially if if it is after an acute illness',\n"," 'to get over a',\n"," 'or to rehab after uh an illness',\n"," 'that is true',\n"," 'i never thought of that',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'sometimes you know sometimes the nursing homes are good for uh just short periods of time',\n"," 'that is true',\n"," 'until they get over that hump',\n"," 'uh huh',\n"," 'of whatever it is they are dealing with',\n"," 'because too often the acute hospitals will are sending them out much faster than what they are noise',\n"," 'yes',\n"," 'really able to',\n"," 'they really are',\n"," 'they do not like to keep them',\n"," 'so',\n"," 'longer than a week',\n"," 'so there is some good to it',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'uh sometimes too it is used as a dumb job',\n"," 'you know the fam',\n"," 'what do you mean',\n"," 'well the families do not necessarily inhaling uh know what to do with them',\n"," 'and they do not want to take the responsibility',\n"," 'so they will put them in a nursing home',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'that is true',\n"," 'so you see uh',\n"," 'there is both sides to it too',\n"," 'what do you think',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'and it depends on how how sick the person is too what you are capable of like if you have a family to take care of you know of your own noise',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'uh smack i would personally like it',\n"," 'if my parents were to get ill i would like to take care of them at home and if i had the money with some help',\n"," 'that is not always possible',\n"," 'that is true',\n"," 'but uh to the best of my ability i d like to do it until it gets impossible inhaling',\n"," 'i think that is also where you are going to have a lot of people who are going to',\n"," 'it is there is not a choice it is',\n"," 'right',\n"," 'because it is not economically feasible even to',\n"," 'uh huh very faint',\n"," 'put them in a nursing home',\n"," 'inhaling yeah',\n"," 'inhaling so that that option sometimes is not available if they do not have the uh noise either medicare or insurance to cover it',\n"," 'that is true',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'so',\n"," 'but i think nursing homes can be good',\n"," 'it just depends on what kind they are',\n"," 'you know you need to check them out ahead of time',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'and then there is also some that are set up for specialties',\n"," 'uh huh',\n"," 'uh i know some',\n"," 'unfortunately some elderly have to go to or have i guess it is alzheimer is or where',\n"," 'uh huh',\n"," 'they wonder or or uh noise confused or have some mental problem noise',\n"," 'smack yeah',\n"," 'that they are noise',\n"," 'and you need a special nursing home for that',\n"," 'you need one that has a unit that is locked where they are not able to get out and roam around',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'and you need people who are trained for that type',\n"," 'right',\n"," 'of problem',\n"," 'who know what they are doing with that',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'so so there is different types of nursing homes i think',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'well my uh grandmother is not really in a nursing home but a retirement home that also has a nursing home sort of attached to it',\n"," 'inhaling and she really liked the idea of of moving there',\n"," 'she is not ill yet',\n"," 'uh huh',\n"," 'inhaling but uh she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years',\n"," 'and then she decided that uh she is eighty five years old that eventually you know she she does not want her family taking care of her and being a burden',\n"," 'she is very independent',\n"," 'inhaling so she is in this nursing home',\n"," 'it is out in the country',\n"," 'and uh she really enjoys it right now smack because she does not have to wash dishes or cook laughter',\n"," 'gives her a little bit of her own independence',\n"," 'uh huh',\n"," 'but she still has uh a security there',\n"," 'right',\n"," 'some support',\n"," 'and then there is also uh sort of a wing for those people that do get sick',\n"," 'and what i like about it and i think she likes about it is that she knows everybody there now',\n"," 'and then so if she ever does become ill uh it will be like family around her',\n"," 'that is right',\n"," 'and i',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'i ve seen some of them like that too',\n"," 'and also they have a lot of uh activities going on for the ones',\n"," 'uh huh very faint',\n"," 'who are more active',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'sh',\n"," 'so it is not sort of like uh uh',\n"," 'uh huh very faint',\n"," 'a sick place',\n"," 'no',\n"," 'she loves it',\n"," 'she has a great social life',\n"," 'and she travels',\n"," 'and uh it is in in the very in the mountains',\n"," 'and it is beautiful',\n"," 'and uh noise i i hope that i have something like that when i get older very faint',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'i i think i think the uh',\n"," 'uh huh very faint',\n"," 'i think that the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the uh elderly',\n"," 'uh huh',\n"," 'uh person who is noise going in and the family that is going to be uh effec effected by it',\n"," 'oh definitely it is',\n"," 'and uh you know sometimes it can those choi those choices can be made in advance',\n"," 'and sometimes',\n"," 'right',\n"," 'the choices because of the nature of the illness when they are',\n"," 'so uh do you happen to be working for a large firm',\n"," 'well it is about three hundred and fifty people',\n"," 'i guess that is not large compared to some',\n"," 'but it is big enough',\n"," 'uh huh',\n"," 'and they have a they do not have any kind of pension plan where they contribute anything',\n"," 'and i wish they did',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'you know they have a four o one k',\n"," 'but i put all the money into it',\n"," 'uh huh',\n"," 'they do not add anything',\n"," 'what about you',\n"," 'uh i work for a fairly large company',\n"," 'it is got eight thousand people',\n"," 'uh huh',\n"," 'and uh breathing we do have health insurance',\n"," 'we do not have four o k one k plan stuff like that',\n"," 'but we do have like retirement',\n"," 'they kind of match up to you',\n"," 'if you put six percent they match up to six percent',\n"," 'and then the rest is whatever you want to put in if you put more than that or something like that',\n"," 'oh that is a pretty good deal',\n"," 'it is not bad',\n"," 'now how long does it take for your contribution to vest',\n"," 'god i do not know',\n"," 'laughter it is probably a long time laughter',\n"," 'i m sure it is not till like twenty five years thirty years',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'the place i work at is health insurance is kind of expensive',\n"," 'it is like hundred bucks a a month or something',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'for a family',\n"," 'huh well i guess what we have is like a f what they call a flex benefits plan where you you get like a certain amount of dollars',\n"," 'and then you spend it on a cafeteria of whatever you want or need',\n"," 'otherwise you can uh lipsmack guess you can put also put money hold money back and then either use or lose it and that does not get taxed or can just have that money you know put in your paycheck',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'we have one of those use it or lose it plans too where uh they will basically pay for uh you know child care type uh expenses',\n"," 'i can send in a uh can send in a request for payment',\n"," 'and they will uh and they will send me you know a check for the amount they withheld',\n"," 'that is pretty good you know',\n"," 'it is uh it saves a third off on taxes or something',\n"," 'yeah faint',\n"," 'well it depends on which company you work for',\n"," 'i know that like the the the one plan that everyone seems to be in in my place is uh you know you f uh think you call it plan d laughter',\n"," 'another example like i guess it is alzheimer is deductibles are really high',\n"," 'it is like fifteen hundred dollars',\n"," 'but if you go for the other ones you are paying too much money for them because it is unlikely if you are f relatively uh healthy then it is really unlikely that you would use that much amount of money you know',\n"," 'so the it you know someone did start a cost benefit analysis',\n"," 'and ends up the best is to take a high deductible and and take a loss what whatever it happens to be if you happen to be a healthy individual laughter',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'i guess',\n"," 'uh on the other hand you know i i had a similar had a similar health plan',\n"," 'and uh one of my kids was in a car accident',\n"," 'and uh',\n"," 'um',\n"," 'i had wound up having to pay for you know a bunch of doctor visits and stuff out of my pocket because of you know no no insurance policy happened to cover it which is',\n"," 'really',\n"," 'you mean not even your your your car insurance',\n"," 'well it it got all screwed up because i had a high deductible on the health insurance no fault here',\n"," 'and and i had a high deductible on the breathing on the uh on the c car insurance',\n"," 'and then s you know we just goofed up the medical insurance and the car insurance and stuff and laughter blew it laughter',\n"," 'lipsmack oh that is too bad',\n"," 'oh well',\n"," 'yeah breathing',\n"," 'uh well i do not know',\n"," 'i think other than health insurance i think uh you know an extra week of uh lipsmack time off would be nice',\n"," 'i only get two weeks',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'my place you get two weeks when you start',\n"," 'and then every every year they give you an extra day until you have got four weeks',\n"," 'oh that is nice',\n"," 'we do not get them till till your seventh year of service till',\n"," 'aye',\n"," 'you get an extra week',\n"," 'that is a long time',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'it is uh',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'especially in the kind of engineering job i m in you know companies do not stay afloat that long laughter',\n"," 'and and they',\n"," 'snorting uh with the telecommunications type of company supposedly you used to be much more stable',\n"," 'it is a lot less stable than it used to be',\n"," 'they used to have job security crap',\n"," 'but now they do not',\n"," 'so you work for bell or something like that',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'it is the bell corps which is uh',\n"," 'right',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'right',\n"," 'so i do not know',\n"," 'it is it is uh no longer laughter',\n"," 'so that is what',\n"," 'i think it is still based on the old model of',\n"," 'and and now they do not uh',\n"," 'a lifelong job security',\n"," 'telephone',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'pioneers of america',\n"," 'all that stuff huh',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'but they no no longer laughter',\n"," 'laughter',\n"," 'i do not think so',\n"," 'laughter right',\n"," 'uh hearing a lo',\n"," 'there is always they are always laying people off which is another benefit that you can have other than salary is trade that off for security',\n"," 'is it i mean does it',\n"," 'they must have pretty good severance though huh',\n"," 'oh i do not know',\n"," 'we do not we have not been doing layoffs',\n"," 'we have been doing uh down sizing with uh getting rid of extra layers of management',\n"," 'and uh i do not know what they do for those people',\n"," 'mean the the the management they get rid of',\n"," 'some of it',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'um',\n"," 'there is too many manage too many chiefs and not enough indians',\n"," 'but',\n"," 'oh they they put',\n"," 'well have you ever served on a jury',\n"," 'no',\n"," 'i ve not',\n"," 'i ve been called',\n"," 'but i had to beg off from the duty',\n"," 'and you',\n"," 'well i was called',\n"," 'and then i was not chosen',\n"," 'um',\n"," 'well i was i was uh originally chosen primarily i think because i was a young fellow',\n"," 'and they tend to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict',\n"," 'i do not know why',\n"," 'something i picked up in a psychology class some time ago',\n"," 'oh really',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'it is that the younger they are they tend to be more conservative for some statistical oddball reason',\n"," 'and inhaling they kind of liked me',\n"," 'i looked conser breathing and all that stuff',\n"," 'and they',\n"," 'i do not know what they saw in me',\n"," 'but they saw it',\n"," 'but uh back to the issue is uh',\n"," 'i do not know',\n"," 'at times i feel that a unanimous decision is warranted especially in cases in which there is no smoking gun',\n"," 'but there too there are also cases in which i feel a majority rule might be acceptable particularly i think in civil cases',\n"," 'in criminal cases i d like to see the unani unanimity remain',\n"," 'but in civil cases i think a majority rule by by jury would be sufficient',\n"," 'well uh could you give me an example of a case where you think that',\n"," 'well in a criminal case say one in which you know there is like say assault or some such i think there ought to be a unanimous uh vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this',\n"," 'and in civil law there you know is such a thing as like let is say uh breathing misappropriations or misuse of financial instruments or something like that',\n"," 'a majority rule i think would be more in line as there is no real smoking gun in the civil cases',\n"," 'i do not know if i m making any sense or not',\n"," 'well i mean i think',\n"," 'are you just trying to say that criminal cases are more uh tangible',\n"," 'or',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'often there is more incriminating evidence',\n"," 'like for instance say uh',\n"," 'and also too i think i m i m tempering this and the fact that the consequences are much more uh serious in a criminal case',\n"," 'well do you think that that in a civil case if there was majority rule that it would be easy for someone to be set up',\n"," 'um well i really cannot say for certain truth be known',\n"," 'uh as it stands there is there is many ways and means by which a person can be set up both uh in a civil uh civil and criminal case',\n"," 'i mean the uh documentary the thin blue line pretty much demonstrated that',\n"," 'you know i do not know for if you are familiar with that or not',\n"," 'no',\n"," 'i m not',\n"," 'a uh fellow breathing when he was much younger uh was tried and convicted and sentenced to death',\n"," 'fortunately in his case the death penalty was revoked',\n"," 'and uh so he served out his his sentence until it was discovered by a fellow who was making a documentary called the thin blue line that this guy had basically gotten railroaded through the judicial system',\n"," 'the case was reopened',\n"," 'and he was exonerated',\n"," 'well i mean i think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'many laws but little justice',\n"," 'say',\n"," 'but uh',\n"," 'and i also think just like you were talking about before why you were chosen to be on a jury that uh the just the process of picking jurors is not always objective',\n"," 'oh certainly not',\n"," 'certainly not',\n"," 'and breathing you know they like to think that they are getting someone who is objective in all this',\n"," 'but they are really looking for someone who will pretty much fulfill the lawyers desires',\n"," 'you know the',\n"," 'because you get up',\n"," 'and and breathing they ask you a few questions',\n"," 'both sides do',\n"," 'and breathing then you you are either challenged which is',\n"," 'you know each attorney can use that as much as they like',\n"," 'or i think it is a limit now',\n"," 'they probably have a limit now',\n"," 'but they pretty much go through that',\n"," 'and then you have to give a reason to the court why you cannot serve',\n"," 'for me it was financial hardship',\n"," 'so but onto the thing uh i was never aware that juries had any say on recommending sentencing',\n"," 'it was always my impression that the justice himself or herself had the final say',\n"," 'okay',\n"," 'so i guess it starts recording now',\n"," 'okay',\n"," 'okay',\n"," 'i do not know really know that much about the recycling in this area that we are in',\n"," 'we live in the saginaw area',\n"," 'saginaw',\n"," 'uh huh',\n"," 'and i m not real familiar with uh anything that',\n"," 'i',\n"," 'fact as far as i know the school does not have any kind of programs or anything out here and uh or the grocery store or anything laughter',\n"," 'really',\n"," 'in this area',\n"," 'yeah',\n"," 'the rec',\n"," 'we live in plano',\n"," 'and they started off recycling by uh putting the',\n"," 'i think at each wal mart they had some recycling dumpsters and things like that which now',\n"," 'i guess the uh city is has bought the big green trash cans',\n"," 'and uh we they have a recycling truck that comes around now',\n"," 'and you separate your glass and paper',\n"," 'uh huh',\n"," 'and uh aluminum',\n"," 'and you set it out',\n"," 'and they pick it up',\n"," 'and it it works real neat',\n"," 'they seem to be having a real good response',\n"," 'really',\n"," 'so',\n"," 'that is pretty good',\n"," 'i m we are originally from another state',\n"," 'and i know in the state we were from that they did that t similar type thing',\n"," 'the city brought ought you know set tr separate trash cans',\n"," 'and you
